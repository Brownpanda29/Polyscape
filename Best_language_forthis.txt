Creating a polymorphic engine, even for educational or research purposes, is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of low-level programming and assembly language. While you can create a polymorphic engine in various programming languages, a lower-level language is typically preferred due to the level of control and optimization required. Some of the languages you might consider for this purpose include:

1. **C/C++**: C and C++ are commonly used for developing polymorphic engines due to their fine-grained control over memory and system resources. You can use inline assembly in C/C++ to manipulate code at a low level.

2. **Assembly Language**: Writing your polymorphic engine in assembly language offers the highest level of control over the generated code. It allows you to create intricate transformations and encryption algorithms.

3. **Python**: While not typically used for low-level programming, Python can be used to automate parts of the polymorphic engine generation process. You can use Python to generate variations of the payload and handle some higher-level tasks.

4. **Rust**: Rust offers memory safety and control similar to C/C++ but with a focus on safety. It might be a good choice if you want to create a polymorphic engine with a lower risk of memory-related vulnerabilities.

Regardless of the language you choose, creating a polymorphic engine is a challenging task that requires in-depth knowledge of computer architecture, assembly language, and encryption techniques. If you're doing this for educational or research purposes, I recommend starting with C/C++ and gradually exploring assembly language to gain a deeper understanding of the low-level aspects involved.

Always approach this type of project with a strong commitment to ethical and legal practices, and be aware of the legal and ethical implications surrounding the use of such technology.
