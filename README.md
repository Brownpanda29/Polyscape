# Polyscape - Polymorphic Code Engine

## Introduction

Polyscape is a polymorphic code engine designed to create ever-changing, adaptable code. This project aims to make code detection and analysis a constant challenge by generating code that morphs and evolves, making it difficult for traditional security measures to keep up.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/brownpanda29/polyscape.git
    ```

2. **Explore Polyscape**:

    Navigate to the project directory and explore the code and documentation to understand how to harness the power of polymorphism.

3. **Incorporate Polyscape**:

    Implement Polyscape's polymorphic capabilities in your own projects to enhance their security and evade detection.

## Note

Polyscape is a work in progress, and the current version serves as a pathway for further development. New features and improvements are actively being worked on.

## Disclaimer

Polyscape is intended for educational and research purposes. Its use in any malicious or unlawful activities is strongly discouraged.
