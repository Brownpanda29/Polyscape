The "content change" or "9th point" in the list of steps related to polymorphic engines refers to the ability of polymorphic malware to alter its code and behavior dynamically during execution. This content change is a tactic used to evade detection and analysis by security software. Here's an explanation of what content change entails:

1. **Dynamic Modification**: Polymorphic malware can modify its content and behavior in real-time, often in response to the environment or the actions taken by security software.

2. **Evasion and Adaptation**: This content change allows the malware to adapt to the situation. For example, if it detects that it's running in a sandbox or virtual environment used for analysis, it might go dormant or act benign to avoid detection.

3. **Stealth**: The malware can alter its content to remain hidden from security scans, dynamic analysis, or behavioral monitoring. It can change its patterns, signatures, or other characteristics to evade detection mechanisms.

4. **Diversification**: Content change adds diversity to the malware's behavior. It may have multiple execution paths and actions, and it can switch between them to avoid predictability.

5. **Network Communication**: Polymorphic malware can change its communication patterns with command and control servers or malicious infrastructure. It may use different communication protocols, ports, or encryption methods during each communication session.

The primary goal of content change in polymorphic malware is to make the malware as unpredictable and evasive as possible. This constantly changing nature makes it difficult for security software to identify and analyze the malware based on its behavior or characteristics. It requires advanced security solutions that use heuristics, machine learning, and other dynamic analysis techniques to detect and respond to the evolving threat.
