The term "constant change" in the context of polymorphic malware refers to the malware's ability to continually alter its code and characteristics, ensuring that each new instance of the malware is different from previous ones. This ever-evolving nature is a fundamental part of how polymorphic malware evades detection.

Here's an explanation of "constant change" in the context of polymorphic malware:

1. **Dynamic Variations**: Polymorphic malware is designed to generate new, unique variants with each iteration. These variations have different code structures, encryption keys, or other characteristics. This constant variation makes it difficult to create static signatures to identify the malware.

2. **Avoiding Predictability**: By changing its code with each infection or distribution, the malware avoids predictability. Security software relies on known patterns and signatures, but with constant change, the malware doesn't exhibit the same patterns consistently.

3. **Frequent Mutations**: With each new infection or distribution, the malware's code is mutated, and, in some cases, it may include randomized elements. This ongoing mutation process ensures that the malware's structure remains fluid.

4. **Adaptive Evasion**: The constant change makes it challenging for security software to adapt and detect the evolving malware. As traditional detection methods fall short, advanced techniques such as behavioral analysis become more important in identifying polymorphic threats.

The concept of "constant change" in polymorphic malware underscores the adaptability and agility of these malicious programs. This feature is employed to evade detection, as it hinders the creation of static signatures and patterns by security software, making it difficult for traditional antivirus solutions to keep up with the ever-evolving threats.
